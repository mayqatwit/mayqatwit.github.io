            I am a Computer Science student at Wentworth Institute of Technology. I am in the graduating class of
            2026 and am looking to continue my education with an M.S. in Applied Computer Science. I have been studying
            computer science since my freshman year of high school, originally learning Python. From there, I have
            learned Java, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. When I am not in class, you can find me in Accelerate, Wentworth's
            student-run makerspace. This is where you can find people making anything from homemade bagpipes
            to full sized canoes! I have interets in AI, game design, and software engineering and development.
            <br><br>However, when I am not behind the keyboard, you can find me playing in many different jazz
            bands and groups. I am in a band called the Blue Snapper that I started with my friends back in the spring of 2021. 
            We spend the summer playing in the streets and resturants of Portland, Maine. I am also in a group called the Saco
            River Jazz Band that spends time playing for nursing homes and retirement homes across Southern Maine.

                    <h2>Wentworth Instant Messaging (WIM)</h2>October 2023 - December 2023 <br> WIM is a free-to-use,
                    LAN instant
                    messenger service. It uses a hybrid peer-to-peer connection that allows users to directly
                    communicate with each other, without the need to communicate with a server to tell it what the users
                    are saying. <br><br>This project implements many different programming techniques and paradigms,
                    such as Python TCP connections, multi-language interfacing, multi-processing, JavaFX, and
                    Scenebuilder. Find more information and try out the program for yourself here: <a class="link"

                    </h2>March 2023 - April 2023<br>Pretzel Clicker is a single-player idle-style
                    game where you click on a large pretzel to collect pretzels, and you can spend those earned pretzels
                    on buildings that can collect pretzels for you without the need to click. You can also save your
                    progress, close the game, and come back at any time to continue where you left off.
                    <br><br>This project was accomplished with several topics, such as Object-Oriented Programming,
                    JavaFX, Interfaces, and File I/O. Find more information and download the project here:

                    Graduated with a 3.7 GPA. During my time at Baxter, I completed numerous year long projects, such as
                    a musical tesla coil, and writing small ensemble orchestrations. These projects were completed for
                    Baxter's Flex Friday program, where students were given the oppertunity to come up with project
                    ideas, write proposals and timelines, and work on their project every Friday for an entire year.
                    This allowed students to better learn how to manage their time, and to work as a team, as most
                    projects were group endeavors.
